<h2> Solution </h2>
ROT13(a special case of Caesar cipher) is a simple substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet. You can solve this by looking for a converter online or you can make your own. I made my own in python. After entering the encoded string I got back the flag.
