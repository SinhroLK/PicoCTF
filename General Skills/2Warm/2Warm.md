<h2> Information </h2>
Points value: 50 points

<h2> Hints </h2>
1. Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if your answer was '11111', you would submit 'picoCTF{11111}' as the flag.
<h2> Solution </h2>
I wrote a short python script 2Warm.py which converts base 10 to binary. After getting the output 0b1010, i manually got rid of 0b since 
its not needed in the flag.
<h2> Flag </h2>
picoCTF{1010}
