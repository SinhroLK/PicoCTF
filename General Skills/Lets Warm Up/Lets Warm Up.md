<h2> Hints </h2>
1. Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.
<h2> Solution </h2>
This one pretty much explains itself. You only need to translate 0x70 from hexadecimal to ASCII. You can do this in a variety of ways. I wrote a short python script
LetsWarmUp.py which translates it for me. You can also use an online converter or do it manually.
<h2> Flag </h2>
picoCTF{p}
