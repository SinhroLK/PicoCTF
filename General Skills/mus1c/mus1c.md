<h2> Solution </h2>
This one was a piece of work. I spent a lot of time just looking at the lyrics but after some time I gave up. Then I tried googling the hint since it looked a bit to specific and thank dear god I got something. I found a website called <a href ='https://codewithrockstar.com/'>codewithrockstar</a>. It turns out that rockstar is a programming language. I copied the lyrics into the online compiler whick gave me some numbers. After running the numbers though an ascii converter I got the flag.
